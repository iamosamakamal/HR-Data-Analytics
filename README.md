# HR-Data-Analytics

HR Data Analytics Dashboard contains some visualizations about employees, I focused my analysis on the current employees only and I used the data for ex-employees for the attrition percentage.

The Legends are on the top of the dashboard along with the filters.

## Created Fields

- I created age bins to visualize the age distribution of the current employees.
- I created a calculated field to separate the number of current employees in a different column to calculate the attrition percentage.

## Insights from the dashboard

- The most frequent age in the company is between 30 and 40 years old.
- There's gender equality in the average salaries, with slight increase of $300 in the female salary.
- The HR department has the lowest number of current employees while the R&D department has the highest number of current employees and the Sales department has the highest attrition percentage.
- The average rating of environment and job satisfaction ranges between 2.7 and 2.9, while the HR Manager role has the highest rating of environment satisfaction of 3.1.
- The R&D team has 145 employees who travel frequently due to business needs.
- The number of male employees in the HR department is significantly higher than the female employees.
